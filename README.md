# Time_Series

Here are my projects related to time series analysis:

- ARIMA-Prophet-LSTM Folder: This folder contains datasets on temperature alongside meticulously detailed notebook files for each model: ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. These notebooks provide comprehensive explanations, including neccessarily statistical tests, models' setup, the rationale behind their use, parameter tuning, and their application to the temperature data for forecasting.

- StackingModels Folder: With more complex weather data, I've expanded the collection with additional models and explanations, focusing on more complex scenarios. It includes:

    - Multivariate Prophet: An extension of the Prophet model to handle multiple variables.
    - VECM (Vector Error Correction Model): Used for analyzing cointegrated time series.
    - To augment the Prophet model's predictive capabilities, I've applied XGBoost to the residuals, enhancing its forecasting accuracy through machine learning refinement.

- Walmart_EDA_Self_Attention Folder: In this project, I explore Walmart sales data through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. Alongside classical tree-based methods, I've incorporated a neural network equipped with a self-attention layer. This approach leverages the self-attention mechanism's ability to capture dependencies, providing nuanced insights and predictions regarding Walmart's sales figures.

Each project is structured to offer a deep dive into the data, backed by thorough explanations and analyses. The goal is to not only forecast accurately but also to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the time series data.
